# 🧠⚡💎 The Gauntlet of Well-Being 💎⚡🧠

A gamified wellness platform inspired by the Infinity Stones concept, designed to solve user engagement challenges in health and wellness apps.

## 🌟 Core Concept

Transform your wellness journey into an epic quest to master the Five Wellness Gems:

- **🧠 Mind Gem** - Mental Clarity & Focus
- **💪 Body Gem** - Physical Health & Energy  
- **❤️ Soul Gem** - Social & Emotional Connection
- **💰 Wealth Gem** - Financial Wellness & Planning
- **🎯 Purpose Gem** - Personal Growth & Purpose

## 🎮 Key Features

### ✨ Interconnectivity System
The revolutionary feature that sets this apart - gems affect each other:
- Neglecting physical activity drains mental clarity
- Lack of social connection weakens physical energy
- Missing purpose affects financial focus
- Soul Gem acts as the foundation affecting all others

### 🎯 Gamification Elements
- **Visual States**: Bright (powered), Dim (inactive), Draining (interconnected effects)
- **Quest System**: Complete daily challenges to power up gems
- **Balance Meter**: Track overall wellness progress
- **Status Messages**: Real-time feedback on gem interactions

### 🧠 Behavioral Psychology Integration
- **Habit Formation**: Small daily actions with immediate rewards
- **Loss Aversion**: Fear of losing progress motivates maintenance
- **Social Accountability**: Soul Gem encourages community engagement
- **Holistic Balance**: Interconnectivity teaches real wellness principles
